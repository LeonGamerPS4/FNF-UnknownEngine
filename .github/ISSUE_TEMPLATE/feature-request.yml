name: Feature Request
description: Stage Editor (from v2.0) has been scrapped until base Psych adds it, so don't ask for it. Winning icons won't be making a return, and I have no plans to add 6K+ support.

      label: To test your sight, and reliability, please select the option of what should NOT be requested.
      options:
        - Proper credit that was forgotten
        - Thing that would not cause problems
        - Useful feature
        - Actual feedback
        - A good idea
        - Stage Editor, 6K+ support, and winning icons.
        - Better LUA mod support idea
        - Code optimization that would make the game faster. (You should make a PR if this is your request, by the way.)
